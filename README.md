<b>Url_Shortner</b>


A URL shortener is a web service that takes long and complex URLs and converts them into shorter, more manageable links. This is particularly useful in situations where you want to share a link, but the original URL is lengthy and impractical. URL shorteners provide a convenient way to share links, especially on platforms like social media, where character limits can be restrictive.

A URL shortener is a valuable tool for simplifying and sharing web links, especially in contexts where brevity and convenience are essential. Whether it's sharing links on social media, in printed materials, or verbally, the ability to convert long, cumbersome URLs into short, user-friendly links makes the process much smoother.
