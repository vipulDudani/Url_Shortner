<b>Url_Shortner</b>


A URL shortener is a web service that takes long and complex URLs and converts them into shorter, more manageable links. This is particularly useful in situations where you want to share a link, but the original URL is lengthy and impractical. URL shorteners provide a convenient way to share links, especially on platforms like social media, where character limits can be restrictive.
